# Document-Scanner
Document Scanner using Python and Digital Image Processing

This repository hosts a Python-based document scanner leveraging the power of Digital Image Processing (DIP).

Features:

1. Efficient Scanning: Transform your images into high-quality scanned documents with just a few lines of code.
2. Adaptive Processing: Our scanner adapts to different lighting conditions and document types, ensuring optimal results.
3. Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrate the scanner into your projects with our well-documented Python code.
4. Customization: Tailor the scanning process to your specific requirements with customizable parameters.

Python modules you might need to import for a document scanner using Digital Image Processing:
-> import cv2  # OpenCV for image processing tasks
-> import numpy as np  # NumPy for numerical operations on images
-> import imutils  # Utility functions for image processing
-> from skimage.filters import threshold_local  # Local thresholding for document detection
-> from scipy.ndimage import interpolation as inter  # Image interpolation for perspective correction
-> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Matplotlib for visualization (optional)
-> import os  # Operating system operations (e.g., file handling)
-> import argparse  # Parsing command-line arguments
-> import glob  # File path pattern matching
-> import pytesseract  # Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction
-> from PIL import Image  # Python Imaging Library for image loading and manipulation
-> import shutil  # High-level file operations (e.g., copying, moving)
-> import math  # Mathematical operations

How It Works:

- Image Capture: Input your images or use a webcam to capture documents.
- Preprocessing: Automatically adjust lighting, contrast, and perspective for optimal scanning.
- Document Detection: Identify document boundaries using advanced image processing techniques.
- Scanning: Extract and enhance the document contents while removing noise and artifacts.
- Output: Save the scanned document in various formats, ready for further processing or archiving.

Why Choose Our Scanner:

1. Accuracy: Our scanner delivers precise results, ensuring clarity and legibility in scanned documents.
2. Speed: With optimized algorithms, scanning is fast and efficient, even for large batches of documents.
3. Flexibility: Whether you're scanning invoices, contracts, or handwritten notes, our scanner adapts to your needs.
